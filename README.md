# Covid19-Prediction

The notebook is documented so just download the zip file or run the command below in a terminal to access the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/jellyCodee/Covid19-Prediction.git
```


To access the _.csv_ file used, unzip the _corona_test.csv_ file. Also download the modules that you may not have to avoid module errors. 

The modules used are in the notebook to make it easier to identify which ones you may or may not have. Happy coding.
